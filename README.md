# CryptFund | Web3 Crowdfunding App
Created a Crowdfunding dApp using the Thirdweb framework as well as React-Vite for the frontend. Used Solidity to write the smart contract, and enabled Metamask to help with crypto transactions. Attached are the two submodules for the client-side (frontend) and the web3 files.
